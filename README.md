# **Alice's ring - Local Ring-Signature Environment**

This exe build in python during the **ETHDenver 2023 hackathon** is the local environnement to create ring signature for Alice's Ring. 
After having obtained the necessary data for the signature on our front end, you can then create your ring-signature locally and have it verified on chain.
